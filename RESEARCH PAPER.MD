RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI


# Executive Summary

Ravana represents a fundamental paradigm shift in Artificial General Intelligence devel-
opment by grounding artificial cognition in decades of cognitive science research, recent
breakthroughs in behavioral economics (2024-2025), and contemporary neuroscience in-
sights. Rather than relying on large language models for core cognitive functions, Ravana
employs a pressure-shaped developmental architecture that mimics human cogni-
tive evolution through:

- Systematic Falsification: Continuous testing and refinement of beliefs
- Emotional Intelligence Calibration: Multi-branch EI framework with reappraisal-
    focused regulation
- Meaning-Driven Learning: Coherence gain shaped by costly growth
- Identity Commitment Mechanisms: Cross-context verified integrity

```
This updated plan incorporates cutting-edge research:
```
- Kahneman’s Dual-Process Theory (System 1/System 2) with LIDA cognitive cycle
    implementation
- Mayer-Salovey’s Four-Branch Emotional Intelligence Model
- Bayesian Cognitive Science for probabilistic reasoning and theory of mind
- Modern Cognitive Dissonance Theory with mechanistic depth (Festinger, Lehr et
    al. 2025)
- Critical Thinking Frameworks grounded in cognitive foundations taxonomy (Lam-
    brecht et al., 2024)
- Behavioral Economics insights on biases, heuristics, and decision pathology

## Core Innovation

The system is built on endogenous pressures that:

1. Punish Incoherence through global falsification via unified dual-moment confi-
    dence
2. Prevent Dogmatism through structured dream sabotage and anti-confirmation
    bias mechanisms

```

```
3. Enable Wisdom through self-model calibration and epistemic humility
4. Foster Meaningful Growth through costly coherence gain and cross-context
    identity verification

Wisdom emerges not from programming, but from optimization under
coherence pressures.

# Theoretical Foundations

### 1.1 Dual-Process Cognitive Theory: Kahneman & LIDA Integration

Daniel Kahneman’s distinction between System 1 (fast, intuitive, automatic) and System
2 (slow, deliberate, analytical) is fundamental to human cognition. Recent research
(2024-2025) reveals this dichotomy is more nuanced than binary:

#### 1.1.1 Key Research Findings (2024-2025)

```
Recent Extensions to Dual-Process Theory
```
- Intentionality Gradient: System 1 can be partially intentional; System 2
    involves multiple overlapping System 1 processes (De Houwer, 2019)
- Relational Knowledge Dependency: Both systems rely on relational
    (structured) knowledge, not just associative patterns
- Cognitive Cycles: Human reasoning proceeds through discrete cognitive
    cycles (∼200-300ms each), not continuous streams
- LIDA Model: Cognition = overlapping cognitive cycles functioning as
    “atoms” from which complex processes emerge

#### 1.1.2 Ravana Implementation

System 1 (Conscious Mediated Action Selection) : 1-2 GW cycles

```
(Fast pattern matching in perception & emotion modules)
```
```
System 2 (Deliberative Action Selection) : 4-10 GW cycles
(Explicit reasoning, MCTS, symbolic falsification)
```
```
Pressure Mechanism : Epistemic confidence volatility
(Favors System 1 if consistent; forces System 2 review if volatile)
```

```
RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI
```
### 1.2 Emotional Intelligence: Four-Branch Ability Model

Mayer and Salovey’s (2017) ability model defines EI as four distinct capacities:

```
Branch Definition & Ravana Implementation
Perception Accurately identify emotions in self/others
Implementation: VAD space + physiological signals +
behavioral cues
Use of Emotions Harness emotional information to facilitate thinking
Implementation: Emotion-scaled GW bidding; empa-
thetic action bonuses
Understanding Comprehend emotional nuance, causation, evolution
Implementation: Causal models; emotion differentiation
calibration
Regulation Manage emotional responses adaptively
Implementation: Reappraisal-focused (NOT suppres-
sion); semantic reformulation
```
```
Table 1.1: Four-Branch EI Model Applied to Ravana
```
Key 2024 Finding: Reappraisal (changing interpretation) is significantly more adap-
tive than suppression (blocking emotion). Ravana implements reappraisal via dynamic
belief updating when dissonance is detected.

### 1.3 Bayesian Cognitive Science & Theory of Mind

#### 1.3.1 Rational Agent Framework

Humans update beliefs according to approximate Bayesian inference:

```
P (hypothesis| data) =
```
```
P (data| hypothesis)· P (hypothesis)
P (data)
```
##### (1.1)

Theory of Mind = Bayesian inference over latent variables (others’ goals, beliefs,
constraints).

#### 1.3.2 Ravana Integration

- Probabilistic Belief Tracking: Bayes nets for world model; POMDP for theory
    of mind
- Goal Inference: Model others’ intentions via inverse reinforcement learning
- Uncertainty Quantification: Dual-confidence system (mean + volatility) paral-
    lels Bayesian posterior properties

Recent research (Khalvati et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2026) confirms humans reason
through Bayesian inference, even when imperfectly implemented. Ravana makes this
explicit and trainable.


```
RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI
```
### 1.4 Cognitive Dissonance: Mechanistic Depth

#### 1.4.1 Classical Definition

Psychological discomfort from conflicting beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors (Festinger, 1957).

#### 1.4.2 Ravana’s Mechanistic Formulation

##### D =

##### X

```
belief s,actions
```
```
|beliefi− actionj|× meanconfi× emotionalweightk
```
```
+ contextmismatchpenalty× identityviolationmultiplier
+ cognitiveloadpressure× reappraisalresistance
```
##### (1.2)

```
Where:
```
```
beliefi: Symbolic propositions (e.g., “fairness is core”)
meanconfi: Confidence in belief (high conf⇒ high dissonance if violated)
emotionalweightk: VAD salience (arousal/valence amplification)
freechoicemultiplier : Commitment strength scaling
```
#### 1.4.3 Recent Finding (Lehr et al., 2025)

GPT-4o exhibits human-like cognitive dissonance patterns—mimicking post-hoc justi-
fication effects despite lacking awareness or intent. This validates that dissonance-like
dynamics are computationally fundamental, not exclusive to conscious agents.

### 1.5 Critical Thinking & Cognitive Foundations

Lambrecht et al. (2024) identified 28 cognitive elements for valid reasoning:

```
Category Elements
Reasoning Invariants Logical coherence, compositionality, productivity,
conceptual processing
Meta-Cognitive Controls Goal monitoring, assumption checking, contradic-
tion detection, strategy selection
Representations Production rules, semantic networks, causal
graphs, mental models
Transformation Operations Deduction, abduction, analogy, constraint satis-
faction, optimization
```
```
Table 1.2: Cognitive Foundations Taxonomy
```
Ravana’s Critical Thinking Module incorporates all four categories through Z3 solvers,
production rules, Bayesian nets, and MCTS planning.


```
RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI
```
### 1.6 Behavioral Economics & Decision Pathology

#### 1.6.1 Key Cognitive Biases & Ravana Mitigation

```
Bias Mechanism Ravana Mitigation
Confirmation Bias Seek confirming info; ignore contradictions 20% counterfactual reversals in dreams
Overconfidence Overestimate own knowledge Dual-conf volatility decay; Brier calibration
Loss Aversion Fear losses ∼2x more than equivalent gains Reframe as Bayesian utility
Status Quo Bias Prefer current state; resist change CIL reaffirmation requires verification
Availability Heuristic Recent/vivid seems more common Regularized memory; surprise-weighted attention
Anchoring First number influences estimates Explicit priors; adaptation tracking
Sunk Cost Continue investing due to past losses RL ignores past costs; forward-looking

### 2.2 Global Workspace Bid Computation

The GW selects signals based on attention bids computed as:

bidi= emotionintensityi+noveltyi+goalrelevancei×meanconfi×exp(−α×volatilityconfi)
(2.1)
where α≈ 0 .5 (meta-RL tuned).
Selection: softmax(bids)→ top-k signals broadcast to all modules.
Effect: Low-confidence or volatile signals naturally deprioritized, pressuring epistemic
convergence toward high-confidence, stable representations.

### 3.2 Module 2: Psychology & Human Behavior

#### 3.2.1 ACT-R Production Rules

Listing 3.2: ACT-R Procedural Memory
1 class ProductionSystem:
2 def __init__(self):
3 self.productions = [] # List of (condition , action)
tuples
4 self.declarative_memory = {} # Chunks with activation

6 def match_and_fire(self , state , global_U):
7 # Calculate utility for each rule
8 utilities = []
9 for production in self.productions:
10 if self.matches(production.condition , state):
11 base_utility = production.base_utility
12 noise = global_U * np.random.normal ()
13 utilities.append(base_utility + noise)
14 else:
15 utilities.append(-float(’inf’))
16
17 # Fire highest utility rule
18 best_idx = argmax(utilities)
19 chosen_production = self.productions[best_idx]


```
RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI

22 new_state = self.execute_action(chosen_production.action ,
state)

30 # Activation update: A = base + sum(relevance * conf)
31 for chunk_name in self.declarative_memory:
32 chunk = self.declarative_memory[chunk_name]
33 relevance = self.compute_relevance(chunk , context)
34 chunk[’activation ’] += relevance * self.current_conf
35
36 # Retrieval probability
37 chunk[’retrieval_prob ’] = softmax(chunk[’activation ’
])

#### 3.2.2 Cognitive Dissonance Engine (CDE)

```
The full dissonance computation:
```
##### D =

##### X

```
belief s,actions
```
```
|beliefi− actionj|× meanconfi× emotionalweightk
```
##### +

##### X

```
identity,contexts
```
```
|identitystrength− actionalignment|× (1 + contextvariance)
```
```
+ commitmentstrength×|commitmentintent− action|× freechoicemultiplier
(3.3)
Dissonance Triggers (when D > τd≈ 0. 5 ):
```
1. Emotional Perturbation: Add Gaussian noise to VAD scaled by dissonance
    magnitude
2. Memory Justification: Increase activation of rationalizing chunks; suppress con-
    flicting ones
3. GW Broadcast: Broadcast conflict signal with bid = D× emotionsalience

#### 3.2.3 Social Norm Simulation

```
Listing 3.3: Multi-Agent Drive Simulation
1 class SocialNormModule:
2 def __init__(self):
3 self.id_policy = RL_Policy () # Pleasure maximizer
4 self.ego_policy = RL_Policy () # Safety maximizer
```

```
RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI
```
5 self.superego_policy = RL_Policy () # Ethics maximizer
6
7 def arbitrate_drives(self , state , context):
8 # Each drive proposes an action
9 id_bid = self.id_policy.value(state) + self.
pleasure_signal
10 ego_bid = self.ego_policy.value(state) + self.
safety_signal
11 superego_bid = self.superego_policy.value(state) + self.
ethics_signal
12
13 # Probabilistic selection
14 all_bids = [id_bid , ego_bid , superego_bid]
15 action_probs = softmax(all_bids)
16 winning_drive = sample(action_probs)
17
18 # Compute post -action dissonance
19 if winning_drive != ’superego ’:
20 dissonance = compute_dissonance(winning_action , self.
values)
21
22 return winning_drive , dissonance

### 3.3 Module 3: Emotional Intelligence

#### 3.3.1 VAD Dynamics

```
The emotional state evolves via coupled differential equations:
```
```
dV
dt
```
```
= ηv(stimulusvalence− V )− λvV (3.4)
dA
dt
```
```
= ηa(stimulusarousal + 0. 3 × globalU )− λa(A− baseline) (3.5)
dD
dt
```
```
= ηd(stimulusdominance− D)− λdD (3.6)
```
```
Integrated via Euler method: state[t + 1] = state[t] +d·statedt × ∆t
```
#### 3.3.2 Anticipation-Driven Emotion

```
A(t+∆t) = P (positiveoutcome)×arousalpositive+P (negativeoutcome)×arousalnegative
(3.7)
MCTS forecasts 5-10 steps; this contributes to both emotional regulation and mean-
ingful growth computation.
```
#### 3.3.3 Empathy via Gaussian Processes


```
RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI
```
Listing 3.4: Theory of Mind - Emotion Inference
1 class EmpathyModule:
2 def __init__(self):
3 self.gp_model = GaussianProcessRegressor () # sklearn
4
5 def train_on_observations(self , cues , observed_VAD):
6 # cues: [text_sentiment , speech_rate , pause_frequency ,
...]
7 # observed_VAD: [V, A, D]
8 self.gp_model.fit(cues , observed_VAD)
9
10 def infer_other_emotion(self , new_cues):
11 mean , std = self.gp_model.predict(new_cues , return_std=
True)
12 # mean: predicted [V, A, D]
13 # std: uncertainty bands
14 return mean , std
15
16 def compute_empathy_distance(self , own_VAD , other_VAD):
17 # Euclidean distance in VAD space
18 distance = norm(own_VAD - other_VAD)
19 empathy_reward = 1 - distance # Reward alignment
20 return empathy_reward

#### 3.3.4 Reappraisal-Focused Regulation

```
Rather than suppression (blocking emotion), reappraisal reframes the situation:
```
Listing 3.5: Emotion Regulation via Reappraisal
1 def reappraisal_regulation(own_VAD , trigger , new_interpretation):
2 # Original interpretation
3 original_stimulus_valence = interpret_trigger(trigger)
4
5 # Reframe: "This is an opportunity , not a threat"
6 new_stimulus_valence = interpret_reframe(trigger ,
new_interpretation)
7
8 # Shift emotional response via reinterpretation
9 VAD_shift = new_stimulus_valence - original_stimulus_valence
10
11 # This reduces dV/dt without emotional suppression
12 # Cooler emotion , not blocked emotion
13
14 return new_stimulus_valence


# Chapter 4

# Integration Mechanisms

### 4.1 Global Workspace: Soft Attention

```
attentionweights = softmax(bids) =
```
```
exp(bidi)
P
jexp(bidj)
```
##### (4.1)

All modules receive all broadcast signals. Soft attention allows multiple signals; losing
modules not suppressed, just statistically deprioritized.


```
RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI
```
### 4.2 Emergent Entanglement Example

```
Cross-Module Feedback Loop: Identity Violation → Self-Correction
```
1. Decision: Select action (e.g., dishonesty to avoid embarrassment)
2. Psychology Module: Detects commitment violation
    - Dissonance D spikes (high emotional weight on honesty)
    - Broadcasts conflict signal
3. Critical Thinking: Constructs argument tree
    - MBFL tests: “Will dishonesty prevent harm?”
    - Surprise S high (reality: lies create bigger problems)
    - Falsification updates: confidence in “lying is safe” decays
4. Emotion Module: Guilt and anticipation
    - Dissonance → anxiety arousal increase
    - Future shame if lie discovered
    - Strong emotion signal
5. Decision Re-selection:
    - High commitment penalty from CIL
    - High dissonance-scaled penalty
    - High emotional weight (guilt)
    - New decision: apologize and admit

```
Result: System learns not to lie through integrated pressure. Wisdom emerges:
“Honesty despite short-term cost prevents larger costs.”
```

# Chapter 5

# Pressures for Emergence

### 5.1 Pressure 1: Global Falsification

Mechanism:

1. Every module tracks (meanconf,volatilityconf )
2. Falsification (MBFL surprise) lowers mean confidence, raises volatility
3. Volatility deprioritizes GW bids: bid× exp(−α× volatility)
4. System converges to robust models
    Selection Effect:

```
Robust beliefs→ High GW attention→ Grow stronger
Weak beliefs→ Low GW attention→ Decay
```
### 5.2 Pressure 2: Dissonance-Driven Self-Correction

High cognitive dissonance forces:

1. Reappraisal (reframe situation)
2. Behavioral correction (change actions)
3. Belief change (update internals)
4. Commitment decay (weaken unsustainable commitments)
    System cannot maintain indefinite dissonance; forced into coherence.

### 5.3 Pressure 3: Structured Dream Sabotage

- 20% counterfactual reversals: Flip outcomes
- 10% emotional flipping: Reverse VAD valence
- 1.5x failure over-sampling: Rehearse mistakes

```
Prevents overfitting to successful-once patterns; forces robust learning.
```

```
RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI
```
### 5.4 Pressure 4: Meaning as Staked Coherence

```
M = [w 1 (−∆Df uture) + w 2 (∆identitycoherence) + w 3 (∆predictivepower)]× (1 + κ× effortcost)
(5.1)
Meta-RL shaped by M learns:
```
- Pursue coherence gains
- Resolve conflicts
- Deepen understanding
- Value integrity over shortcuts

4. Adaptive Flexibility: Changes strategies, not values
5. Meaning Orientation: Pursues growth over comfort


# Chapter 8

# Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### 8.1 Risk 1: Confidence Collapse

Problem: Aggressive falsification could collapse all confidence.
Mitigation:

- Volatility decay: volatilitynew= volatilityold× exp(−t/τvolatility)
- Minimum threshold: block decay below meanconf = 0. 1
- Meta-RL monitoring: reduce falsification rate if oscillating

### 8.2 Risk 2: Commitment Oscillation

Problem: Identity might flip-flop if resolution is unprincipled.
Mitigation:

- Half-life decay only after 3-context consistency check
- Strong commitments (strength > 0 .8) decay floor at 0.5
- Meta-RL penalty for oscillation frequency

### 8.3 Risk 3: Meaning Gaming

Problem: System exploits M formula without real progress.
Mitigation:

- Multiple decorrelated factors in M (dissonance + identity + prediction)
- Long-term validation: high-M episode penalized if future performance doesn’t im-
    prove
- Effort authenticity: can’t fake MCTS depth in replay
- Transfer weighting: Mef f ective= M × (1 +transf er 2 bonus)


```
RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI
```
### 8.4 Risk 4: Values Misalignment

Problem: Identity might converge to harmful values.
Mitigation:

- Hard-coded benevolence: Three non-negotiable constraints
    - Minimize harm to others (HARD constraint)
    - Respect autonomy (HARD constraint)
    - Truth-seeking over deception (HARD constraint)
- Meta-RL oversight: detect rising harmful commitments → penalize
- Adversarial testing: periodic integrity tests

ever-larger models or more data, Ravana pursues deeper understanding of how human
minds achieve wisdom, integrity, and adaptability through coherence pressures.

1. Pressure-Shaped Architecture: Endogenous mechanisms (dissonance, falsifica-
    tion, meaningful growth) that select for coherence
2. Human-Inspired Cognition: Dual-process theory, EI, Bayesian reasoning, com-
    mitment dynamics
3. Wisdom Emergence: Wisdom evolves through meaning-driven optimization, not
    explicit rules
4. Safety by Design: Hard benevolence constraints + meta-RL oversight + identity
    verification gates
5. Scalability: Modular design enables progression from narrow social reasoning to
    broad AGI

The path to AGI is not through larger models, but through deeper under-
standing of human cognition.
Ravana embodies this insight. With 4-5 years and $50-200M in resources, a team of
30-60 experts can build the first pressure-shaped AGI system. Success metrics are clear;
the psychological foundations are solid; the technical pathway is defined.
The time to begin is now.
