# RAVANA: Advanced Cognitive Architecture for AGI Development

**RAVANA** is a cognitive architecture for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that grounds artificial cognition in established findings from cognitive science, behavioral economics, and neuroscience. Instead of relying on large language models as the core cognitive substrate, RAVANA proposes a **pressure-shaped developmental system** inspired by human cognitive evolution.

---

## Overview

Modern AGI approaches often emphasize scale-driven statistical learning. RAVANA takes a different path by focusing on **developmental pressure**, **cognitive coherence**, and **human-aligned psychological structure**.

The architecture is designed to:
- Punish incoherence and rigid dogma
- Encourage adaptive reasoning under constraint
- Support cross-context identity consistency
- Enable cognitive growth through structured internal pressure

---

## Core Foundations

RAVANA integrates concepts from multiple domains, including:

- **Dual-Process Theory** (System 1 / System 2 reasoning)
- **LIDA Cognitive Cycle**–inspired control flow
- **Emotional Intelligence models** (Mayer–Salovey ability framework)
- **Bayesian reasoning** and probabilistic cognition
- **Cognitive dissonance theory** with mechanistic grounding
- **Behavioral economics** insights on bias and decision pathology
- **Critical thinking taxonomies** grounded in cognitive science
