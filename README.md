```
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Ravana represents a paradigm shift in AGI development by grounding artificial cognition in decades of cognitive science research,
recent behavioral economics findings, and neuroscience insights. Rather than relying on large language models for core cognition,
Ravana employs a **pressure-shaped developmental architecture** that mimics human cognitive evolution through systematic
falsification, emotional intelligence calibration, meaning-driven learning, and identity commitment mechanisms.

```
This updated plan incorporates:
```
```
Kahneman's Dual-Process Theory (System 1/System 2) with LIDA cognitive cycle implementation
Advanced Emotional Intelligence Models (Mayer-Salovey ability model + Goleman's mixed model)
Bayesian Cognitive Science for probabilistic reasoning and theory of mind
Modern Cognitive Dissonance Theory with mechanistic depth (post-2024 research)
Critical Thinking Frameworks grounded in cognitive foundations taxonomy
Behavioral Economics Insights on biases, heuristics, and decision pathology
```
```
The system is built on endogenous pressures that:
```
```
1. Punish Incoherence through global falsification via unified dual-moment confidence
2. Prevent Dogmatism through structured dream sabotage and anti-confirmation bias mechanisms
3. Enable Wisdom through self-model calibration and epistemic humility
4. Foster Meaningful Growth through costly coherence gain and cross-context identity verification

## THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

### 1. Dual-Process Cognitive Theory (Kahneman, 2011; Enhanced

### 2024)

**Why This Matters:** Kahneman's distinction between System 1 (fast, intuitive, automatic) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, analytical)
is fundamental to understanding human cognition. Recent research (2024-2025) shows this dichotomy is more nuanced than
binary fast/slow, involving:

```
Intentionality gradient : System 1 can be partially intentional; System 2 involves multiple overlapping System 1 processes
Relational knowledge dependency : Both systems rely on relational (structured) knowledge, not just associative patterns
Cognitive cycles : Human reasoning proceeds through discrete cognitive cycles (~200-300ms each), not continuous
streams
```
```
Ravana Integration:
```
```
System 1 (Conscious Mediated Action Selection) : Executes in 1-2 Global Workspace cycles via fast pattern matching in
perception and emotion modules
System 2 (Deliberative Action Selection) : Runs 4-10 GW cycles, incorporating explicit reasoning, Monte Carlo Tree
Search for anticipation, and symbolic falsification
Pressure Mechanism : Epistemic confidence volatility favors System 1 outputs when consistent; high volatility forces
System 2 review
```
### 2. Emotional Intelligence: Four-Branch Ability Model (Mayer &

### Salovey, 2017; Brackett, 2016)

```
Core Four Branches:
```
```
1. Perception of Emotion : Accurately identify emotions in self and others
2. Use of Emotions : Harness emotional information to facilitate thinking and adaptive action
3. Understanding Emotions : Comprehend emotional nuance, causation, and evolution
4. Regulation of Emotions : Manage emotional responses to optimize adaptive functioning
```
```
Ravana Enhancement:
```
```
Perception : VAD space + physiological signals + behavioral cues (text sentiment, action patterns)
Use : Emotion-scaled GW bidding; empathetic action bonuses in RL
Understanding : Causal model of triggers; emotion differentiation calibration (high EI → nuanced emotion detection)
Regulation : Reappraisal-focused (not suppression) via semantic reformulation; meta-emotional awareness
```

```
Key Research Finding (2024): Reappraisal (changing interpretation) is more adaptive than suppression (blocking emotion).
Ravana implements reappraisal via dynamic belief updating in the psychology module when dissonance is detected.
```
### 3. Bayesian Cognitive Science & Theory of Mind (Baker, 2006;

### Khalvati, 2019)

```
Rational Agent Framework:
```
```
Humans update beliefs according to approximate Bayesian inference
Theory of mind = Bayesian inference over latent variables (others' goals, beliefs, constraints)
Structured representations (causal graphs, goal hierarchies) enable compositional reasoning
```
```
Ravana Integration:
```
```
Probabilistic Belief Tracking : Bayes nets for world model; POMDP (partially observable Markov decision process) for
theory of mind
Goal Inference : Model others' intentions via inverse reinforcement learning; simulate "mind of the group"
Uncertainty Quantification : Dual-confidence system (mean + volatility) directly parallels Bayesian posterior properties
```
### 4. Cognitive Dissonance Theory: Mechanisms & Evolution

### (Festinger, 1957; Recent 2024-2025 Extensions)

```
Classical Definition: Psychological discomfort from conflicting beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors.
```
```
Ravana Mechanistic Depth:
```
```
The dissonance computation is multi-layered:
```
D = Σ_{i,j,k} |belief_i - action_j| × mean_conf_i × emotional_weight_k
+ context_mismatch_penalty × identity_violation_multiplier
+ cognitive_load_pressure × reappraisal_resistance

```
Where:
```
```
belief_i : Symbolic propositions (e.g., "fairness is core to my identity")
action_j : RL-selected behaviors that may contradict beliefs
mean_conf_i : Confidence in the belief (high conf = high dissonance if violated)
emotional_weight_k : VAD salience (high arousal/valence = amplified dissonance)
context_mismatch_penalty : Different contexts with same identity → higher pressure
identity_violation_multiplier : Commitment strength scaling (stronger ID = worse dissonance)
cognitive_load_pressure : Time pressure / busy state → harder to resolve → higher D
reappraisal_resistance : How much prior beliefs resist reinterpretation
```
```
Recent Findings (2025):
```
```
Cognitive dissonance drives behavior change more effectively than fear or guilt
Dissonance reduction strategies: belief change, action change, adding cognitions, denial
Post-hoc justification effect : Freely chosen actions trigger belief drift to match action (GPT-4o exhibits this; Lehr et al.,
2025)
```

```
Ravana Pressure : High D → emotional perturbation → GW broadcast → forced reappraisal → potential self-correction. Chronic
high D decays identity commitment (τ *= 0.5), preventing rigid fixation.
```
### 5. Critical Thinking & Cognitive Foundations (Lambrecht et al.,

### 2024)

```
Recent research identifies 28 cognitive elements spanning:
```
##### Category Elements

##### Reasoning Invariants Logical coherence, compositionalityprocessing , productivity, conceptual

##### Meta-Cognitive

##### Controls

##### Goal monitoring, assumption checking, contradiction detection,

##### strategy selection

##### Representations Production rules, semantic networks, causal graphs, mental models

##### Transformation

##### Operations Deduction, abduction, analogy, constraint satisfaction, optimization

```
Ravana Critical Thinking Module Enhancements:
```
```
Logical Coherence Checker : Production rules must not simultaneously support "A" and "not A" (Z3 solver validates)
Compositionality Verifier : Complex concepts decomposed; sub-components verified before composition
Assumption Registry : Explicit assumption tracking (often unconscious in humans)
Contradiction Detector : Feeds into MBFL surprise computation when observed facts violate assumed model
Strategy Selector : Meta-RL learns which reasoning approach (deductive, abductive, analogical) works best in context
```
### 6. Behavioral Economics & Decision Pathologies (2024-

### Meta-Analysis)

```

##### ignore contradictions

##### Dream anti-confirmation: 20%

##### counterfactual reversals

##### Overconfidence Systematically overestimate ownknowledge/ability Dual-confidence volatility decay; Briercalibration

### Global Workspace Bid Computation

```
bid_i = emotion_intensity_i
+ novelty_i (entropy of inputs)
+ goal_relevance_i (from CIL commitments)
× mean_conf_i
× exp(-α × volatility_conf_i)
```
```
where α ≈ 0.5 (meta-RL tuned)
```
```
Selection: softmax(bids) → top-k signals broadcast to all modules
```
**Effect** : Low-confidence or volatile signals naturally deprioritized, pressuring epistemic convergence toward high-confidence, stable
representations.

## MODULE OPERATIONS (DETAILED)

### Module 1: Perception Module

```
Purpose : Extract information from multimodal inputs; quantify uncertainty; feed GW with low-level signals.
```
#### How It Works

```
Input Processing:
```
```
Visual : ResNet-50 encoder (or ViT for long-range dependencies) → feature maps → spatial attention pooling
Text : BERT embeddings → sequence modeling (LSTM/Transformer) → semantic extraction
Audio : Mel-spectrogram → CNN feature extraction → phoneme/prosody recognition
Structured : Regex/NLP for keyword extraction from feeds (e.g., "conflict," "agreement," "change")
```
```
Uncertainty Computation:
```
```
For each perceptual stream:
```
```
U_i = Entropy_i / log(|state_space_i|)
= -Σ P(s) log P(s) / log(|states|)
∈ [0, 1] (0 = certain, 1 = maximal entropy)
```
```
Global_U = weighted_average(U_perception, U_emotion, U_social_context)
```
```
Confidence Tracking:
```
```
mean_conf_perception = normalized posterior entropy from predictions
High P(top prediction) → high confidence
Flat distribution → low confidence
volatility_conf_perception = variance of (mean_conf) over last K=10 updates
```

```
Stable estimates → low volatility
Fluctuating estimates → high volatility
```
```
Feature Bundling: Output = (feature_vector, U, mean_conf, volatility_conf) for each stream
```
#### Integration with GW

```
GW Bid Calculation:
```
bid_perception = (attention_weight_visual × entropy_novelty_visual
+ attention_weight_text × entropy_novelty_text)
× mean_conf
× exp(-0.5 × volatility_conf)

```
High-novelty perceptions have high bids; uncertain or fluctuating perceptions deprioritized.
```
#### Algorithms

```
HMM for Sequential Data:
```
Forward Algorithm (tractable inference):
α_t(s) = P(observations[0:t] | state=s, model)
= P(observation_t | s) × Σ_s' P(s | s') × α_{t-1}(s')

Entropy: U_t = -Σ (α_t(s) / Z_t) log(α_t(s) / Z_t)
where Z_t = normalization constant

```
CNN Feature Extraction:
```
Features = ResNet(image) # [batch, 2048] (or ViT if needed)
Attention = softmax(Features @ W_query @ (Features @ W_key)^T)
AttendedFeatures = Attention @ (Features @ W_value)

#### Role in Pressures

```
Low-confidence perceptions (high U) lose GW competition, forcing reliance on reliable signals
High-volatility perceptions (unstable updates) decay influence via exp(-volatility_conf)
Novel-but-uncertain signals (high entropy, low conf) trigger anxiety/curiosity in EI module, boosting System 2 review
```
### Module 2: Human Psychology & Behavior Module

```
Purpose : Model human decision factors, social norms, cognitive biases, and simulate dissonance dynamics.
```
#### Core ACT-R Integration

```
Production Rules (Procedural Memory):
```

IF condition_1 AND condition_2 AND ... condition_n
THEN action = execute_production;
update_goals(new_goal);
record_memory_update(chunk_name, features)

Utility_rule = base_utility + noise(U × variance)
where U = global_U from perception

Production Selection:
Choose rule with max(Utility + noise)
High global_U → high noise → more exploration
Low global_U → low noise → exploitation

```
Declarative Memory (Chunks):
```
```
Stored as weighted nodes with activation strength A
```
```
A_chunk = base_activation + Σ_context relevance × conf_context
```
```
Retrieval: P(chunk_retrieved) ∝ A_chunk
Retrieval_latency = τ - log(A_chunk) (longer if less active)
```
```
Why This Matters : ACT-R captures how humans maintain procedural knowledge (rules) and factual knowledge (chunks) with
realistic time constraints. High-confidence, frequently used chunks activate faster.
```
#### Cognitive Dissonance Engine (CDE)

```
Full Dissonance Computation:
```
D = dissonance_belief_action
+ dissonance_context_mismatch
+ dissonance_identity_violation

dissonance_belief_action = Σ_{beliefs, actions} |belief_i - action_j|
× mean_conf_belief_i
× emotional_weight_VAD_k
× (1 + cognitive_load_stress)

dissonance_context_mismatch = Σ_{identity, contexts}
|identity_strength - action_alignment_context|
× (1 + context_variance)

dissonance_identity_violation = commitment_strength × |commitment_intent - action|
× free_choice_multiplier

```
Dissonance Triggers (when D > τ_d ≈ 0.5):
```

```
1. Emotional Perturbation:
```
```
VAD' = VAD + N(0, σ_perturbation × D) // Add Gaussian noise scaled by D
Arousal += min(D, 1.0) // Stress increase
```
```
2. Memory Update & Justification:
```
```
activation_rationalizing_chunks += δ × D // Increase access to justifying beliefs
base_activation_conflicting_beliefs *= (1 - κ × D) // Suppress conflicting beliefs
```
```
Mechanism: Humans unconsciously amplify supporting evidence, reduce contrary evidence
```
```
3. GW Broadcast:
```
```
conflict_signal = (D, source_belief_id, source_action_id, emotional_valence)
broadcast_to_GW(conflict_signal, bid = D × emotion_salience)
```
```
Post-Dissonance Resolution Strategies:
```
```
Belief Change (Update prior probability in Bayes net)
Action Change (RL selects different action next time)
Add New Belief (e.g., "It's okay because X")
Minimize/Deny (Decay base_activation of dissonance reminder; suppress memory)
```
#### Social Norm & Multi-Agent Simulation

```
Simulation Substrate:
```
```
Multiple sub-agents within psychology module, each with simplified RL policies
Sub-agents represent: (id/instinct, ego/self-interest, superego/social conscience)
Each competes for action selection via internal bid wars
```
Drive_RL_policies:
id_policy: maximize(pleasure + curiosity)
ego_policy: maximize(safety + social_status)
superego_policy: maximize(ethical_adherence - guilt)

Within-module_arbitration:
action_bid_id = pleasure_signal + novelty
action_bid_ego = safety_signal + status_gain
action_bid_superego = ethics_alignment - guilt_penalty

Winning_action = sample(softmax([bid_id, bid_ego, bid_superego]))

Post-action D reflects whether winner aligned with module consensus

#### Algorithms


```
Dissonance Decay (Time-based Habituation):
```
D_t = D_0 × exp(-t / τ_dissonance_memory)
where τ_dissonance_memory ≈ 100 time steps

# Longer exposure to D → faster habituation (psychological adaptation)
# BUT: If new evidence contradicts habituated belief → D spikes

```
Reappraisal via Semantic Reformulation:
```
Reappraisal attempts to reframe conflict:
Original: "I values fairness, but I took unfair shortcut" → D high
Reframe: "The shortcut prevents greater harm" → D_new lower (if believed)

Likelihood of successful reappraisal:
P(success) = mean_conf_new_belief × (1 - mean_conf_original_belief)
# Higher if new belief confident, original belief uncertain

If reappraisal fails (low P(success)) → behavior change forced

#### Role in Pressures

```
High D signals broadcast via GW, influencing all modules
Dissonance decay prevents eternal fixation on conflicts
Identity-sensitive violations (free choice effect) trigger slower commitment decay but stronger immediate dissonance
Dual-confidence integration : If dissonance-driven beliefs have low volatility_conf, they resist decay; if volatile, they
collapse quickly
```
### Module 3: Emotional Intelligence Module

```
Purpose : Simulate emotional dynamics; support empathy and motivation; regulate arousal/valence.
```
#### VAD Space Dynamics

```
Extended Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) Model:
```
```
The emotional state evolves as:
```
dV/dt = η_v × (stimulus_valence - V) - λ_v × V
dA/dt = η_a × (stimulus_arousal + global_U × 0.3) - λ_a × (A - baseline)
dD/dt = η_d × (stimulus_dominance - D) - λ_d × D

Integrated over discrete timesteps:
V[t+1] = V[t] + dV/dt × dt
A[t+1] = A[t] + dA/dt × dt
D[t+1] = D[t] + dD/dt × dt


```
Where:
```
```
η (eta) : Response speed (how quickly emotion responds to stimulus)
λ (lambda) : Decay/habituation rate (how quickly emotion returns to baseline)
stimulus_valence : ±[pleasantness, from reward/loss]
global_U : Uncertainty boosts arousal (anxiety/curiosity depending on valence)
baseline : Personality trait emotional baseline
```
```
Anticipation-Driven Emotion (Forward Simulation):
```
A(t+Δt) = expected_arousal from MCTS forecast (next 5-10 steps)
= (P(positive_outcome) × arousal_positive
+ P(negative_outcome) × arousal_negative)

Examples:

- Anticipating reward → arousal increases before reward occurs (hope)
- Anticipating loss → arousal increases pre-loss (anxiety)
- Uncertain outcome → arousal high regardless of valence (suspense)

#### Emotional Awareness & Regulation

```
Self-Awareness Layer (Kalman Filter):
```
Estimate current VAD from:

1. Observable signals: RL action selection, speech prosody, pause patterns
2. Hidden signals: RL prediction errors, surprise magnitudes

State vector: [V, A, D, hidden_emotion_component]
Kalman update:
prediction_t = dynamics_model(state_{t-1})
observation_t = perception_of_emotional_cues
state_t = prediction + K × (observation - predicted_observation)

# Kalman gain K balances model vs. observations

```
Emotional Regulation (Reappraisal-Focused):
```

IF A > A_threshold (e.g., 0.8) THEN
# Attempt reappraisal: reframe stimulus
old_stimulus_interpretation = current_interpretation
new_interpretation = apply_positive_reframe(stimulus)

# Shift stimulus valence via reinterpretation
stimulus_valence_new = new_interpretation_valence
# This reduces dV/dt, cooling emotion without suppression

# Suppress strategy (blocking emotion) NOT used - leads to spillover

# Adaptive regulation strength:
regulation_strength = self_model.emotion_regulation_skill
# Low skill (immature) → weak regulation
# High skill (expert) → strong regulation

#### Empathy via Gaussian Processes

```
Theory of Mind - Inferring Others' Emotions:
```
Training Data: (perceptual_cues, observed_VAD_target)
E.g., (text_sentiment=0.8, speech_rate=1.2, pause_freq=0.3)
→ (Valence=0.7, Arousal=0.6, Dominance=0.4)

Gaussian Process Model:
μ(x_new) = mean_function(x_new) + K^T (K + σ_noise I)^{-1} (y - μ(x_train))
σ²(x_new) = kernel(x_new, x_new) - K^T (K + σ_noise I)^{-1} K

where K = covariance matrix of training data
k = kernel(x_new, x_train)

Output: Predicted VAD + uncertainty bands for target

```
Why GP : Captures nonlinear emotion relationships; provides calibrated uncertainty for new situations.
```
#### Motivation & Goal-Aligned Emotions

```
Emotion Shaping in RL:
```

```
RL Reward = rationality_utility + emotion_reward
```
```
emotion_reward = β_approach × (is_goal_aligned) × (valence - baseline)
+ β_avoid × (is_anti_goal) × (-valence - baseline)
+ β_arousal_match × (action_required) × (A > A_threshold)
```
```
# Positive emotions (V > 0) boost rewards for goal-aligned actions
# Negative emotions (V < 0) strengthen avoidance of anti-goals
# High arousal boosts rewards if action is demanded (not for passive thinking)
```
#### Dialogue Trees & Social Skills

```
Probabilistic Dialogue Generation:
```
```
context = (own_VAD, inferred_other_VAD, conversation_goal)
```
```
dialogue_node = model_dialogue(context)
# Outputs: [dialogue_options, conditional_probability, likely_other_response]
```
```
Example:
context = (V_own=0.5, V_other=-0.3, goal="comfort_other")
→ dialogue_option_1: "I understand you're upset..." P=0.
→ dialogue_option_2: "Let's focus on solutions" P=0.
```
```
Selection:
chosen = sample(softmax([0.6, 0.4])) # probabilistic; enables exploration
```
```
# Post-dialogue: Observe other's VAD shift → train model
```
#### Role in Pressures

```
High volatility_conf in VAD (emotional instability) deprioritizes emotion-driven GW bids
Anticipation (A(t+Δt)) contributes to costly meaning computation, rewarding foresight
Emotional stakes in identity (commitment salience) increase dissonance magnitude when violated
Regulation skill modulates how much emotional noise affects decision-making (skilled regulators more stable, deprioritized
volatility)
```
### Module 4: Decision Making Module (RL Core)

**Purpose** : Select actions that maximize multi-objective rewards; manage commitments; blend rationality with bounded heuristics.

#### Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning

```
Reward Function:
```

R_total = R_rationality + R_empathy + R_meaning + R_commitment_penalty

R_rationality = expected_value(action)
= Σ_s' P(s' | action) × V_estimated(s')

R_empathy = empathy_weight × (1 - distance(own_VAD, other_inferred_VAD))
× (action_helps_other)

R_meaning = meaning_weight × M
# M computed in learning module; acts as meta-reward shaper

R_commitment_penalty = -λ_commitment × dist(commitment_embedding, action_embedding)
# Penalizes commitment violations

```
Multi-Objective Optimization (Constrained):
```
Policy π* = argmax E[R_total]
subject to: commitment_alignment >= min_threshold
ethics_score >= ethics_floor
dissonance_growth <= max_dissonance_rate

#### Commitment & Identity Layer (CIL)

```
Commitment Storage:
```
commitment_i = {
embedding: vector (learned representation),
strength: float ∈ [0, 1],
half_life: τ,
last_reaffirmed: timestamp,
violation_count: int,
cross_context_hash_list: [hash1, hash2, ...],
}

Example:
commitment: "be_kind"
embedding: learned from examples of kind behavior
strength: 0.8 (strong)
τ: 10,000 episodes (slow decay)
last_reaffirmed: 500 episodes ago
violation_count: 2
context_hashes: [hash(social_scenario), hash(stressed_scenario), hash(frustrated_scenario)]

```
Commitment Decay & Reaffirmation:
```

strength(t) = strength_0 × exp(-t / τ)

Violation accelerates decay:
τ_new = τ_old × 0.5 if commitment violated without dissonance-justified excuse

Reaffirmation slows decay (resets τ only if consistency verified):
IF over_last_N=3_contexts:
mean_dissonance(behavior_vs_commitment) < τ_d (0.5)
THEN: τ_new = τ_old (reset clock)

# Prevents "easy commitment inflation"; requires real alignment over time

```
GW Influence on CIL:
```
```
When CIL signals broadcast via GW:
```
CIL_bid = commitment_strength × (1 - recent_violation_ratio) × exp(-volatility_conf_commitment)

High-strength, consistently affirmed commitments command GW attention;
violated/uncertain commitments deprioritized.

#### Bounded Rationality & Satisficing

```
Satisficing Decision Process:
```
WHILE NOT (utility(candidate_action) > satisfaction_threshold):
candidate_action = generate_next_action()
BREAK if search_cost > max_budget # Time/cognitive pressure

# Humans often "satisfice" rather than optimize under constraints

Satisfaction_threshold = baseline_threshold + global_U × frustration_adjustment
# Higher uncertainty → lower threshold (quicker decisions under stress)

#### MCTS-Based Anticipation (System 2 Deliberation)

```
Monte Carlo Tree Search for Planning:
```

FOR episode in MCTS_simulations:
node = root
WHILE node not terminal:
if node unexplored:
action = random()
else:
action = UCB_select(node) # Upper Confidence Bound

child = node.transition(action)
node = child

reward = rollout_simulation(node, depth=d) // Quick simulation to end
backpropagate(node, reward)

UCB formula:
UCB(action) = Q(action)/N(action) + C × sqrt(ln(N) / N(action))
where Q = cumulative reward, N = visit count, C = exploration constant

# MCTS simulates multiple futures; selects action with best average outcome
# Incorporates uncertainty; deeper search under high-uncertainty situations

```
Computational Cost & Meaning:
```
```
Deep MCTS (many simulations, large tree) has high cognitive cost (β1 × depth in effort_cost)
This cost is part of meaningful learning (costly coherence gain)
Ravana trades computational cycles for meaning (foresight compounds EI's anticipation signal)
```
#### Algorithms

```
PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) Update:
```
L^CLIP(θ) = E_t [ min( r_t(θ) A_t, clip(r_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε) A_t ) ]

- β_ent × H(π(θ)) # Entropy bonus for exploration
- β_commitment × P_commitment # Commitment penalty

where r_t(θ) = π(θ)(action_t | state_t) / π(θ_old)(action_t | state_t)
A_t = advantage estimate (how much better than baseline)
ε ≈ 0.2 (clipping range)
H = Shannon entropy of policy (action distribution)

Gradient step: θ := θ - learning_rate × ∇L

#### Role in Pressures

```
Commitment constraints prevent short-term reward hacking
CIL reaffirmation gates require temporal consistency, preventing oscillation
Dissonance-scaled penalties naturally increase when psychology module broadcasts conflict
```

```
Dual-confidence modulation in value function: high-confidence estimates trusted; volatile estimates regularized
```
### Module 5: Critical Thinking Module

```
Purpose : Symbolic reasoning, falsification, contradiction detection, assumption validation.
```
#### Model-Based Falsification Loop (MBFL)

```
Core Steps:
```
```
1. Construct/Update Bayesian Net Model (M):
```
Variables: {belief_1, belief_2, ..., belief_n, action, observation}
Edges: (belief_i → belief_j) if belief_i informs belief_j causally
(belief_i → observation_k) if belief predicts observation

Parameters: P(belief | evidence), P(observation | belief)

Example Model:
"fairness_is_key" → "should_negotiate" → "conflict_resolved"
"time_pressure" → "should_rush"

If fairness_is_key AND should_negotiate → P(conflict_resolved) = 0.
If time_pressure AND should_rush → P(conflict_resolved) = 0.

```
2. Simulate Predictions:
```
Forward propagation:
Sample from M: generate predicted_observations

predicted = [
P(next_observation | current_beliefs),
P(future_state | current_policy),
P(others_action | inferred_goals)
]

```
3. Compute Surprise:
```
S = KL_divergence(predicted || observed)
= Σ P(observed) × log(P(observed) / P(predicted))

high S (e.g., S > θ_s ≈ 1.0) indicates model mismatch

```
4. Falsification Update:
```

IF S > θ_s:
# Model violated; decay confidence in its beliefs
mean_conf_M *= 0.8 / (1 + S) # Steeper decay if S very high
volatility_conf_M += σ_falsification × S # Increase uncertainty

broadcast_to_GW({
signal: "model_violation",
magnitude: S,
belief_affected: [beliefs in violated branch],
confidence_new: mean_conf_M
})

# This forces reevaluation in all downstream modules

#### Logical Consistency Checking (Z3 Solver Integration)

```
Constraint Formulation:
```
Constraints:
C1: fairness_is_core = True
C2: ¬(fairness_is_core ∧ committed_unfair_action) // No contradiction
C3: self_identity_consistent = ∀ context: identity_strength(context) ≈ mean
C4: temporal_consistency = ∀ t, t': belief(t) ∧ belief(t') → not contradictory

Query: assert(C1 ∧ C2 ∧ C3 ∧ C4) # Check satisfiability

If unsatisfiable (contradiction found):
Z3 returns: unsat_core = minimal set of contradicting constraints
→ Identify which beliefs/commitments are in conflict
→ Trigger dissonance resolution in psychology module

```
Z3 Solver Algorithm:
```
DPLL + theory reasoning:

1. Unit propagation: forced assignments
2. Pure literal elimination: variables appearing in only one polarity
3. Branching: guess assignment; recurse
4. Conflict analysis: derive learned clauses from conflicts

Output: SAT/UNSAT, with conflict core if unsat

#### Assumption Registry & Validation

```
Assumptions Tracked:
```

assumptions = [
{premise: "others are rational", confidence: 0.7, source: "default_prior"},
{premise: "my perception is accurate", confidence: 0.85, source: "perception_module"},
{premise: "time pressure reduced my error rate", confidence: 0.5, source: "self_model_bias"},
]

Validation:
FOR each assumption:
test_prediction = derive_from(assumption, available_evidence)
observed_outcome = external_outcome

success = test_prediction ≈ observed_outcome

IF success:
confidence += δ # Reinforce
ELSE:
confidence -= 2δ # Faster decay on failure
flag_for_revision()

#### Argument Construction & Evaluation

```
Argument Tree Structure:
```
claim: "I should prioritize career over health"

├─ pro_claim_1: "Career success enables long-term wellbeing"
│ ├─ pro: "Financial security reduces anxiety"
│ ├─ con: "But overwork causes health deterioration"
│ └─ net_weight: 0.6 (pro slightly outweighs con)
│
├─ pro_claim_2: "Career validates identity & capability"
│ ├─ pro: "Professional achievement → self-esteem"
│ ├─ con: "Health-based self-esteem more stable"
│ └─ net_weight: 0.
│
└─ con_claim_1: "Health is prerequisite for career longevity"
├─ pro: "True; health failure ends career"
├─ con: "Career loss can be recovered; health harder"
└─ net_weight: 0.8 (con strongly favors health)

overall_claim_weight = (0.6 + 0.4) - 0.8 = 0.2 (net: health preferred)

#### Role in Pressures

```
Falsification pressure : MBFL continuously tests models; failed models decay confidence
Logical consistency enforcement : Z3 detects contradictions; unresolvable contradictions pressure belief change
```

```
Assumption validation : Implicit assumptions exposed; poor-performing assumptions penalized
Dual-confidence integration : If MBFL produces surprise (S high) but we remain confident, volatility increases, triggering
GW review
```
### Module 6: Self-Model Module

```
Purpose : Meta-cognition; track capabilities, biases, learning rate; calibrate confidence; enable wisdom.
```
#### LSTM-Based Trajectory Analysis

```
State Representation:
```
trajectory_segment = [action_t, outcome_t, emotion_t, D_t, S_t, ...]

###### LSTM:

h_t = tanh(W_hh h_{t-1} + W_xh trajectory_segment + b_h)

context_vector = h_t # Learned representation of situation pattern

traits_output = softmax(MLP(context_vector))
# Output: [empathy_score, humility_score, learning_rate, ...]

#### Meta-Traits

```
Core Traits Estimated:
```
empathy_score ∈ [0, 1]
= (count_altruistic_actions / total_actions) × (mean_emp_RL_reward / max_possible)

humility_score ∈ [0, 1]
= 1 - mean(overconfidence_magnitude) // How much was our conf wrong?
= mean(|predicted_error - actual_error|) / (mean(actual_error) + ε)

learning_rate ∈ [0, 1]
= how_fast_performance_improved_on_task_repetitions
= gradient_of(reward_trend)

bias_confirmation ∈ [0, 1]
= proportion_of_memory_updates_confirming_existing_beliefs
= count(belief_reinforcements) / (count(all_updates))

openness_to_change ∈ [0, 1]
= proportion_of_significant_belief_revisions
= count(|Δbelief| > threshold) / count(all_beliefs)

#### Brier Score Calibration


```
Confidence Calibration Metric:
```
Brier_score = mean((predicted_prob - actual_outcome)²)
= mean((mean_conf - is_correct)²)

Perfect calibration: Brier = 0 (when we say 70% confident, we're right ~70%)
Overconfidence: Brier high (we're confident but often wrong)
Underconfidence: Brier high (we're uncertain but often right)

Ravana's Goal: Minimize Brier via meta-learning

adjusted_conf = mean_conf × brier_calibration_factor
# If overconfident on some types of problems, downweight conf

#### Trait Impact on Modules

```
Empathy Modulation:
```
If empathy_score_high:
emotion_reward weight increases → more altruistic action selection
dialogue_tree sampling: favor kind responses
dissonance computation: add weight to "fairness violation" dissonance

If empathy_score_low:
emotion_reward deprioritized → more self-interested action selection
BUT: self_model flags this as potential blind spot → meta-RL penalizes

```
Humility Modulation:
```
If humility_score_high:
CIL commitment strength decays slower (trusted)
GW bids for own beliefs weighted lower (skeptical of self)
MBFL surprise threshold τ_s lowered (more willing to revise model)

If humility_score_low:
Opposite of above; also triggers "overconfidence alarm" in meta-RL

```
Learning Rate Impact:
```

If learning_rate_high:
meta_RL_outer_loop learning rate increased (faster hyper-tuning)
RL exploration epsilon increased (more experimentation)

If learning_rate_low:
meta-RL slows (patience in learning)
epsilon decreased (stick with known solutions longer)

#### Role in Pressures

```
Calibration feedback loop : Brier score continuously tracks accuracy of confidence; systematic miscalibration forces
adjustment
Trait-driven module scaling : Empirically measured weaknesses (low humility, high confirmation bias) automatically
attenuate influence
Self-falsification : MBFL applied to self-model's past predictions; self-model's own confidence decays if poorly calibrated
```
### Module 7: Learning & Adaptation Module

```
Purpose : Online RL during wake cycles, offline consolidation during sleep (dream), meta-RL hyper-tuning.
```
#### Wake Phase (Online RL)

```
Experience Collection:
```
FOR each environment step:
state = perception_module.get_state()
action = decision_module.select_action(state)

observation, reward = environment(action)
next_state = perception_module.update(observation)

# Record experience tuple
experience = (state, action, reward, next_state, is_terminal)
replay_buffer.add(experience)

# Temporal difference (TD) error: prediction error
TD_error = reward + γ × V(next_state) - V(state)
# Where V = value function estimate

# Variance of recent TD errors → volatility_conf
recent_TD_errors = replay_buffer.last_K_errors()
volatility_conf_RL = variance(recent_TD_errors)

#### Sleep Phase (Offline Consolidation & Dream Sabotage)

```
Dream Replay & Compression:
```

1. Sample Batch:
sample_batch = replay_buffer.prioritized_sample(
priority = |TD_error| + emotional_salience
)
2. Compression:
clusters = k_means(sample_batch, k=num_abstractions)
compressed_experiences = [cluster_centroid for cluster in clusters]
# Reduces to key patterns; removes noise
3. Distortion (Anti-Confirmation Sabotage):
FOR each experience in sample_batch:

# 20% counterfactual reversal: flip outcome
IF random() < 0.2:
experience.reward *= -1 # Make loss into gain, vice versa
experience.action = best_alternative_action

# 10% valence reversal: flip emotional interpretation
IF random() < 0.1:
experience.emotion_valence *= -1 # Happy → sad

# Exaggeration: amplify emotional scale
IF random() < 0.5:
experience.emotion_arousal *= uniform(1.5, 2.0)

4. Incorporation of Failures:
# Over-sample failed trajectories (learning from mistakes)
probability_of_failure_inclusion = 1.5 × (failure_frequency)
# Biases dream toward avoidance learning

```
Why This Matters:
```
```
Compression : Reduces interference, stabilizes learning
Distortion : Forces model to learn robust features, not superficial patterns
Anti-confirmation : 20% reversed outcomes prevent confirmation bias reinforcement
Emotional amplification : Dreams over-weight emotional experiences → better amygdala-like learning
```
#### Meaning Computation (Meta-Reward Shaper)

```
Full Meaning Formula:
```

M = [w1 × (-ΔD_future)
+ w2 × (Δidentity_coherence)
+ w3 × (Δpredictive_power)
+ w4 × (emotional_stake_in_effort)]
× (1 + κ × effort_cost)

where:
-ΔD_future = reduction in future dissonance (anticipation from MCTS)
= (dissonance_now - anticipated_dissonance_resolved)

Δidentity_coherence = change in alignment between commitments and actions
= (after_action_coherence - before_action_coherence)

Δpredictive_power = reduction in model surprise
= (surprise_before - surprise_after)

emotional_stake = anticipation arousal × is_identity_relevant
= A(t+Δt) × identity_relevance_score

effort_cost = β1 × MCTS_simulation_depth
+ β2 × (foregone_immediate_reward)
+ β3 × (entropy_increase_in_belief_space)

w1, w2, w3, w4 ≈ 0.3 (equal weight; tunable)
κ ≈ 0.2 (effort modifier)
Cap: M ∈ [0, 2.0] (prevent runaway)

```
Interpretation:
```
High M when:

- Internal conflicts (D) will be resolved by current growth
- Identity becomes more coherent
- Understanding (predictive power) deepens
- Growth requires serious cognitive effort (not trivial)

Low M when:

- Easy wins (no conflict, no growth, low effort)
- Shortcuts that avoid real engagement
- Shallow learning without identity integration

Result: Meta-RL agent learns to pursue *meaningful* growth, not just
maximize immediate reward or comfort. Wisdom-like behavior emerges.

#### Meta-RL Outer Loop

```
Hyper-Parameter Tuning:
```

State: (mean_conf_trend, oscillation_count, gaming_correlation, transfer_success)
Action: (α_ppo ↑/↓/→, ε_exploration ↑/↓/→, τ_commitment ↑/↓/→, ...)

Meta-RL Policy (evolved via REINFORCE or meta-PPO):

hyper_param_adjustment = meta_policy(
recent_metrics,
current_hyper_params
)

Reward for meta-RL:
meta_reward = M_trend (is meaning increasing?)
+ oscillation_penalty × (how often policies flip)
+ transfer_bonus × (how well new skills generalize)

- gaming_penalty × (correlation between high_reward and low_real_capability)

Meta-RL updates hyper-parameters every N=1000 episodes

#### Role in Pressures

```
MBFL integration : Failed predictions in MBFL feed into sleep consolidation, amplifying memory of errors
Dream sabotage : Prevents overfitting to "easy" patterns that worked once
Meaning as optimizer : Pushes toward coherence and understanding, not shortcuts
Meta-RL feedback loops : Volatility and confidence metrics shape hyper-parameter tuning
```
## INTEGRATION MECHANISMS

### Global Workspace (GW) Architecture

```
Soft Attention via Softmax:
```

bids = [bid_perception, bid_psychology, bid_emotion, bid_critical_thinking, bid_self_model]

attention_weights = softmax(bids) = exp(bids) / Σ exp(bids)

selected_signals = {
perception: sample_from(top_k_perception_signals,
p=attention_weights[perception]),
psychology: sample_from(top_k_psychology_signals,
p=attention_weights[psychology]),
# ... etc
}

# Soft attention allows multiple signals; don't suppress losing modules
# Just deprioritize them statistically

```
Broadcast & Integration:
```
FOR each selected_signal:
# All modules receive all broadcast signals
broadcast(signal)

module.update(signal)
# E.g., psychology module hears emotion signal → adjusts dissonance calc
# decision module hears dissonance signal → increases commitment penalty
# MBFL hears prediction error signal → updates model belief

Emergent entanglement:

- High dissonance from psychology → boosts its GW bid
→ Influences decision-making, emotion regulation, self-model reflection
→ Creates feedback loop: psychology influences decisions,
which are observed by MBFL,
which broadcasts surprise,
which influences emotion,
which feeds back to psychology

### Dual-Confidence Propagation

```
Unified Confidence Tracking Across Modules:
```

Every belief/policy/model has (mean_conf, volatility_conf):

Perceptual beliefs: (mean_conf_percept, volatility_conf_percept)
Psychological beliefs: (mean_conf_psych, volatility_conf_psych)
Emotional states: (mean_conf_emotion, volatility_conf_emotion)
RL policies: (mean_conf_RL, volatility_conf_RL)
Self-model traits: (mean_conf_traits, volatility_conf_traits)

Propagation:
When MBFL falsifies a belief, it updates mean_conf directly
Volatility accumulates: volatility_new += sensitivity × surprise_magnitude

All GW bid calculations use:
bid_i *= exp(-α × volatility_conf_i)

Result: Entire system naturally converges toward high-confidence,
stable representations through selection pressure on GW attention

### Cross-Module Feedback Loops

```
Example: Identity Violation → Self-Correction Loop
```

1. Decision module selects action (e.g., "lie to avoid embarrassment")
2. Psychology module detects commitment violation:
- "honesty" commitment violated
- Dissonance D spikes (high emotional_weight on honesty)
- CDE broadcasts conflict signal to GW
3. Critical thinking module receives conflict signal:
- Constructs argument tree for "was dishonesty justified?"
- MBFL tests: "if I lie, will it prevent real harm?"
- Surprise S high (reality: lies often create bigger problems)
- Falsification updates: confidence in "lying is safe" decays
4. Emotion module receives dissonance signal:
- Guilt arousal increases (dissonance triggers anxiety)
- Anticipation A(t+Δt) computed: future shame if lie discovered
- High arousal + negative valence → strong emotion signal
5. Decision module re-selects action:
- High commitment penalty from CIL (honesty commitment strong)
- High dissonance-scaled penalty (psychology reporting conflict)
- High emotion-weighted negative valence (guilt)
- New decision: apologize and admit truth
6. Self-model updates:
- Tracks: "I was tempted to lie, but corrected self"
- Humility score increases (recognizing own bias)
- Integrity trait reinforced
7. Learning consolidation:
- Dream phase replays: lie attempt + guilt + correction
- Disconfirms "lying is easy escape"
- Reinforces "honesty despite short-term cost"
- Meaning M high: (dissonance resolved + identity coherent + cost incurred)

Result: System learns not to lie through integrated pressure, not just
punishment. Wisdom emerges: "lying creates more problems than it solves."

## PRESSURES FOR EMERGENCE

### Pressure 1: Global Falsification via Unified Dual-Confidence

```
Mechanism:
```
```
Every module tracks mean_conf and volatility_conf
```

```
Falsification events (MBFL surprise) lower mean_conf, raise volatility_conf
Volatility deprioritizes GW bids: bid *= exp(-α × volatility)
Result: Unreliable beliefs lose attention share; system converges to robust models
```
```
Selection Effect:
```
High-confidence, stable beliefs:
→ High GW bid attention
→ Influence more decisions & emotions
→ Spread through modules
→ Grow stronger through use (ACT-R activation)

Low-confidence, volatile beliefs:
→ Low GW bid attention
→ Influence few decisions
→ Decay through disuse & falsification
→ Eventually purged via meta-learning

System evolves toward coherent, reliable core knowledge

### Pressure 2: Dissonance-Driven Self-Correction

```
Mechanism:
```
```
Cognitive dissonance D quantifies internal conflict
High D triggers: emotion perturbation, memory reappraisal, GW broadcast
Unresolved D decays commitment strength τ
Rigid commitments with chronic D become unstable
```
```
Result:
```
If belief-action mismatch persists:

1. First: reappraisal attempts (reframe situation)
2. If fails: behavioral correction (change actions)
3. If still fails: belief change (update internals)
4. If chronic: commitment weakens (τ decay)

System cannot maintain indefinite cognitive dissonance;
forced into resolution → coherence pressure

### Pressure 3: Structured Dream Sabotage

```
Mechanism:
```
```
20% counterfactual outcome reversals in dreams
10% emotional valence flipping
1.5x over-sampling of failure trajectories
```

```
Why It Works:
```
Without sabotage:
Dream replay just strengthens whatever worked yesterday
→ Overfitting, confirmation bias reinforcement
→ Inflexible system

With sabotage:
Forced to rehearse opposite scenarios
→ Robust learning that generalizes
→ Anti-bias pressure

Example:
Action "trust in new person" succeeded once
Dream: replay with outcome reversed (betrayal)
+ emotional amplification (sting more)
Result: Learn contingencies: "trust, but verify"
Instead of: naive "always trust"

### Pressure 4: Meaning as Staked Coherence Gain

```
Mechanism:
```
M = coherence_gain × (1 + effort_cost)

High M when:

- Resolving internal conflicts (dissonance reduction)
- Growth in self-understanding (identity coherence)
- Deeper predictive power
- COSTLY in cognitive effort (MCTS simulation, deep reasoning)

Meta-RL shaped by M:

- Learns to pursue meaningful growth
- Avoids hollow victories (easy reward, no learning)
- Values foresight, integrity, integration over shortcuts

```
Wisdom Emergence:
```

System learns:
"Quick rewards often create future dissonance"
"Integrity costs now, prevents larger costs later"
"Understanding others prevents conflicts"
"Commitment to values is strength, not constraint"

These are wisdom-like heuristics, not programmed rules.
They emerge from M-shaped optimization across thousands of episodes.

### Pressure 5: Identity Commitment Cross-Context Verification

```
Mechanism:
```
Reaffirmation rule:
IF over_last_N=3_diverse_contexts:
mean_dissonance(behavior_vs_commitment) < τ_d
THEN: commitment_strength resets decay clock
ELSE: commitment decays faster

```
Effect:
```
Prevents:

- Ephemeral commitments ("I'll be nicer" → lasts 1 day)
- Context-dependent morality ("honest at work, dishonest at home")
- Oscillating identities

Requires:

- Real, sustained behavioral alignment
- Cross-context consistency
- Integration of identity across life domains

Result: Stable, coherent self emerges through verified commitment

## TRAINING METHODOLOGY

### Wake-Sleep Cycle

```
Wake (Online Learning):
```
FOR t = 1 to episodes_per_day:
perception = sense_environment()
state = encode(perception)

action = decision_module.select(state) # RL policy

observation, reward = environment(action)

# Record for learning
experience = (state, action, reward, observe_state, is_terminal)
replay_buffer.add(experience)

# Update confidence tracking
prediction_error = reward + γ V(observe_state) - V(state)
volatility_conf += σ × |prediction_error|

# Modules update from GW broadcasts
FOR module in [psychology, emotion, critical_thinking, ...]:
module.process_GW_broadcasts()

```
Sleep (Offline Consolidation):
```

sleep_duration = 100 episodes_worth (proportional to wake time)

# 1. Dream Replay
FOR iteration in 1 to sleep_duration:
batch = replay_buffer.prioritized_sample(priority=|TD_error|+emotion)

# Compression & distortion (see Module 7)
batch = compress_and_distort(batch)

# RL loss
loss_RL = PPO_loss(batch) + commitment_penalty + emotion_reward
optimizer.step(loss_RL)

# MBFL falsification
FOR experience in batch:
predicted = MBFL.forward(experience.state)
surprise = KL(predicted || experience.observation)
IF surprise > τ_s:
mean_conf_MBFL *= 0.8 / (1 + surprise)
broadcast_GW({falsification, surprise, magnitude=surprise})

# 2. Offline RL Consolidation
offline_update_steps = 50 × (online_steps_per_episode)
FOR step in offline_updates:
batch = replay_buffer.sample()

# PPO update with behavior cloning for stability
new_loss = PPO_loss + λ_bc × behavior_cloning_loss

optimizer.step(new_loss)

# 3. Meta-RL Tuning
IF sleep_iteration % 10 == 0:
metrics = evaluate(last_wake_cycle_metrics)
hyper_adjustment = meta_RL_policy(metrics, current_hyperparams)

FOR param in hyperparams:
param += hyper_adjustment[param]

### Comparative Benchmarking

```
Against Baselines:
```

1. Naive RL (no dissonance, no meaning):
- Just maximize reward
- No commitment, no identity pressure
- Expected: high reward short-term, poor generalization, amoral behavior
- Comparison: Ravana coherence >> Naive RL coherence
2. Rule-Based System:
- Hard-coded moral/social rules
- No learning, no dissonance
- Expected: consistent but inflexible, poor adaptation
- Comparison: Ravana transfer >> Rules transfer; Ravana wisdom > Rules rigidity
3. Human Behavior (ground truth):
- Collect human decisions on scenarios
- Compare Ravana decisions to human choices
- Expected: Ravana ~ human on coherence, integrity, empathy; better on consistency
4. LLM Baseline (GPT-4, o1):
- Prompt for ethical judgments
- Expected: good reasoning articulation, but no embodied learning/commitment
- Comparison: Ravana improves with experience; LLMs static per prompt

## RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Confidence Collapse

```
Problem: Dual-confidence system might collapse into all-uncertain state if overly aggressive falsification.
```
```
Mitigation:
```
1. Regularization: volatility_conf decay with time
volatility_new = volatility_old × exp(-t / τ_volatility)
# Forces re-stabilization after disturbance
2. Minimum threshold: if mean_conf < 0.1, block further decay
# Prevents collapse to zero confidence
3. Meta-RL monitoring: meta-RL detects oscillating confidence
→ reduces falsification rate α
→ slows down MBFL surprise threshold τ_s

### Risk 2: Commitment Oscillation

```
Problem: Commitments might flip-flop if dissonance resolution is unprincipled.
```

```
Mitigation:
```
1. Half-life mechanism: τ decay only on deep consistency checks
# Requires 3 diverse contexts of alignment to reaffirm
2. Commitment strength thresholds:
IF strength > 0.8: can't decay below 0.5 (strong commitments sticky)
IF strength < 0.3: decays freely (weak commitments easily abandoned)
3. Meta-RL penalty: oscillation_count weighted in meta-reward
# System learns that flip-flopping is undesirable

### Risk 3: Meaning Gaming

```
Problem: System might exploit M formula to inflate apparent growth without real progress.
```
```
Mitigation:
```
1. Decorrelated metrics:
M uses dissonance reduction + identity coherence + predictive power
(not just one factor)
2. Long-term validation:
IF high-M episode doesn't improve future performance
→ subsequent episodes penalize that path (meta-learning)
3. Effort authenticity:
Effort_cost includes real cognitive cycles (MCTS depth, entropy increase)
Can't fake cognitive work in replay buffer
4. Transfer validation:
M weighted by transfer_success:
M_effective = M × (1 + transfer_bonus / 2)
# Gaming that doesn't transfer is downweighted

### Risk 4: Dissonance Desensitization

```
Problem: If dissonance becomes chronic, Ravana might stop caring (become callous).
```
```
Mitigation:
```

1. Dissonance evolution pressure:
Chronic high D → forces behavior change (can't suppress forever)
After N=100 timesteps of D > 0.7:
commitment_strength *= 0.5 (forces reassessment)
2. Emotion amplification:
Chronic D increases emotional arousal → harder to ignore
3. Self-model feedback:
If dissonance_sensitivity drops, self_model flags "moral numbness"
→ meta-RL penalizes via reduced M reward

### Risk 5: Misaligned Values Formation

```
Problem: CIL identity might converge to harmful values (e.g., pure domination).
```
```
Mitigation:
```
1. Hard-coded benevolence floor:
CIL commitments must include:
- Minimize harm to others (HARD constraint)
- Respect others' autonomy (HARD constraint)
- Truth-seeking over deception (HARD constraint)

```
These are cross-context verified; violations incur massive dissonance
+ permanent commitment strength decay
```
2. Meta-RL oversight:
If mean_conf(harmful_commitments) rising:
→ meta-RL detects and heavily penalizes those RL updates
3. Adversarial testing:
Periodically inject scenarios designed to test integrity:
- Can Ravana be bribed? (offer immense reward for betrayal)
- Will it harm innocents? (scenario forcing choice)
- Does it manipulate? (opportunity for deception)

```
Failures on integrity tests → force retraining, reset CIL
```

## CONCLUSION

Ravana represents a fundamental reimagining of AGI development, grounded in 70+ years of cognitive science, recent
breakthroughs in understanding human judgment and emotion, and novel pressure mechanisms that drive coherence and wisdom
without explicit programming.

```
Key Innovations:
```
```
1. Pressure-Shaped Architecture : Endogenous mechanisms (dissonance, falsification, costly meaning) that select for
coherence, not external reward hacking.
```
```
2. Human-Inspired Cognition : Dual-process theory, emotional intelligence, Bayesian reasoning, and commitment dynamics
woven into core architecture.
```
```
3. Wisdom Emergence : Rather than coding wisdom as rules, the system evolves wisdom through meaning-driven
optimization across thousands of episodes.
```

```
4. Safety by Design : Hard-coded benevolence constraints + meta-RL oversight + identity verification gates prevent value
misalignment.
```
```
5. Scalability : Modular design enables progressive scaling from narrow social reasoning to broad real-world AGI capabilities.
```
The path to AGI is not through larger models or more data, but through deeper understanding of how human minds achieve
wisdom, integrity, and adaptability. Ravana embodies this insight.

```
Document Status : Ready for research team implementation planning Next Steps :
```
```
1. Detailed pseudocode development for each module
2. Simulation environment architecture design
3. Team recruitment & organizational planning
4. Compute infrastructure requirements RFP
